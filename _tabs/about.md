Hi there, I'm an AI student at KCL. I like programming and enjoy the idea of spotting subtle problems in our daily lives and using software programming to either solve them or make the process better. I'm using blog posts to document some of the steps I took to learn new things or set up projects.

I also enjoy films and books, so I'll make some recommendations and share my thoughts on them here.

<!-- ### My fav movie:

 **Blade Runner** (Original and 2049) they are both equally good, but in different ways. I have also read the book, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" I was surprised by the huge difference between them. It's kind of like open-source software; each of them has made some improvements on the other. But the core of the story, the dystopian emotion, and the philosophical discussion are kept perfectly.

### My fav book:
 **Klara and the Sun** This book was definitely my introduction to the sci-fi world (yep, that's late). As you can see, I have a passion for all those dystopian stories. I think the story is charming and beautiful, and at the centre of those dystopian stories, the theme of themes is love. We humans are not perfect; what makes us human is our contradictory emotions, our selfishness, shame, and a lot of other not so good things. The texts are beautiful. Ishiguro has crafted a believable world there, and I feel like I was right there with Klara, looking at the sunset.
